                    <h3 class="text-left mt-4 para-title"> ECONOMY OF LADAKH:</h3>
                    <p class="text-left mt-2 mb-3 description">                    
Ladakh, nestled in the Himalayas, is a cold desert region. For a major portion of its existence, subsistence agriculture along with pastoralism has been the backbone of both the society as well as the economy of Ladakh. This changed dramatically after 1947 Ladakh became a part of the state of Jammu & Kashmir in India. As a region bordering China and Pakistan, Ladakh was important to India’s defense and several armed forces were moved into the area. These have also provided employment to many Ladakhis and livelihood opportunities for others.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
In 1974, the region was opened to visitors from outside and now tourism has established itself as the leading industry within the economy due to its ability to generate employment opportunities and as well as income on large scale. Apart from tourism, other sectors include: Horticulture, Sheep and Animal Husbandry, Handicraft, Cooperatives, Banking among other entrepreneurial enterprises.

<h3 class="text-left mt-4 para-title"> RELIGION:</h3>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
The divisional region of Ladakh, in the Jammu &amp; Kashmir state, comprises of Leh and Kargil district. Population of less than 2 lac people (as per the 2011 Census of India) are scattered over a terrain, that is the largest district in the entire republic of India. This district is also the most sparsely populated region of India, with a population of about 3 people per square meter.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Religion wise, the region of Ladakh has Buddhists, Muslims, in majority, with Christians,  Hindu as well as Sikh communities (residents)in lesser numbers.  Due to massive migration, the floating population during summer season ( due to many factors like tourism, construction work etc.) and the Army population stationed in the region of Ladakh, have not been considered in the census count.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Therefore, it is very difficult to ascertain the demographic numbers for the entire district quite well. With the passage of time, the new census survey could change the above numbers drastically.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Broadly, Leh district is  Buddhist majority  and the Kargil district, a Muslim majority. Oral history as well as local historians trace the advent of Islam to the saint- scholar Mir Sayed Lao Hamdani, who passed through Ladakh towards Kashgar (Chinese Turkistan), after his second visit to Kashmir in 1381 or 1382 A.D. (Sheikh 2010:65) However, according to archaeological evidences, it has been stated that Muslims passed through the village Tangtse, where big boulders hold engravings, names of army commandents and administrators of Central Asia in Arabic inscriptions . Presently, the Muslims of this region belong to the Shia, Sunni, Nurbakshi and Ahle Hadith sects.  (Sheikh 2010:66) While, hundreds of mosques throng the Kargil district,  one can find famous mosques like the Jamma Masjid, Leh; the Imamia Masjid which is the oldest Mosque, the mosque of Chushot Yogma as well as the imambara (also in Chuchot) are also considered to be some of the oldest mosques in the region.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
The Buddhist sect followed in Ladakh is of the Mahayana tradition. Buddhist traditions or schools like the Kagyu (Drug-pa, Dri-gung-pa ), Ge-lugs-pa, Sas-kya (Matho monastery) and Nyingma -pa (Tak-thak monastery). Several monasteries throng the region of Ladakh covering almost the entire Leh region. The landscape of the region is a marker of the Buddhist tradition with chorten (or stupas ), mani-walls, monasteries, prayer flags (big and small), water prayer wheels, everywhere.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Somehow due to the strong visibility of the Buddhist religion markers, most of the time, the identity of the people of Ladakh, as seen by outsiders is that of a Buddhist identity.The idea of a Ladakh and the identity of a person from Ladakh, irrespective of religion and faith, gets romanticised due to a lot visual stimulation in the form of monasteries and Buddhist iconography.Hence, the identity of other faith gets overshadowed and as a person visiting Ladakh, we need to keep that not all Ladakhis are of one faith, as represented in many  coffee table books.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
The Christian community of Ladakh are scattered in Leh, Shey and Khalatse villages. Historically, the Chirstian community follow the Moravian Brethren, a protestant denomination, historically from (Lower Saxony) in present day Czech Republic, Europe. The centre for them is the Moravian Church in Leh, Shey as well as the Khalatse Church,where the present day congregational meeting or gatherings are held.   
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Many of the migrated populations like those from Hindu families, or Sikh families have lived in Ladakh for few generations. Many families have managed to stay here, where they are and in turn have imbibed a bit of the local culture but follow their own faith.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Hindus have constructed few Hindu temples in places like Leh, where they celebrate their religious festivities like Diwali, Dusheera etc. The Sikh community is also very visible in Leh. They claim that their guru, Guru Nanak visited Ladakh, (although there are many contesting discourse alongside this claim.)
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Presently, they have an establishment built as the Guru Nanak Sahib in Chutey Rantak, Leh. A big tree locally known as Lharchang, a tree that holds a Buddhist deity, is claimed to be the Datun (toothbrush) of Guru Nanak and stated to have been planted at that site. Another location, just below the Ladakh Konka Pass, towards NImoo village, lies a big Gurudwara. This site holds a big boulder that is also considered a sacred site of Guru Rinpoche, a saint from the Vajrayana tradition, who is said to left the imprint of his back on the same boulder. It is also claimed that Guru Nanak rested on this boulder during his visit through Ladakh. Hence, the Gurudwara was established on that site. With the settlement of the army in different parts of Ladakh, one can also see a rise in the number of temples, shrines, etc. that are made by devoted believers of different religions, all over Ladakh. Creation of religious sites, then slow capturing of land area around those sites is a common problem that have been faced in many areas/ villages of Ladakh.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Religion is a tool that can either work as a binding factor for a society, or can be used as a tool to divide it. The onus of religious tolerance and religious pluralism lies on the people but greater responsibility lies on our leaders (both civil as well as political).

<h3 class="text-left mt-4 para-title"> LANGUAGE:</h3>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 

The spoken language of this region is called Ladakhi or Bhoti. Other languages spoken in Ladakh are Balti, Purig-skat, Shina/Dard-skat as well as different dialects of Ladakhi such as Leh-skat, Shyam-skat, Chang-skat. Urdu, Hindi and English are all now widely spoken as well.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
The script to write Ladakhi is called Bodyig or the Tibetan script. Urdu as a script has also been used for a long time here, both spoken as well as in official records.  Even today, Ladakhis use a lot of Urdu words in their daily conversations. There are also many words whose root can be traced to Central Asian languages such as Persian, Uyghyur, Yarkandi; as well as Kashmiri, Punjabi and of course Tibetan.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description">
Religious affinity was a major factor in the blending of words, but trade, matrimonial alliances within and outside this region (in the past) affected the way language shift has been taking place in this region.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description">
​Over the years, the use of Ladakhi language (both spoken and written) has been going through a process of decline with western education and migration due to education. There has been a drop in the number of speakers of the languages. Efforts at revival are also being made by many organization to create awareness and encourage more Ladakhis to learn their language, with summer classes both written and spoken are organized in Leh.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
In contemporary times, Ladakhi as a language is being given due importance and promoted by the government, schools and religious organizations. Writing in fiction and poetry are also being encouraged, and gaining popularity.

<h3 class="text-left mt-4 para-title"> MUSIC:</h3>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
“Tibet was known as the place where Buddhism flourished, China for its discipline, and Ladakh for its music and songs”
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
​The words of a song illustrate the importance of music in Ladakh. Historically, Ladakh has a rich tradition of music with songs for almost all occasions, lu being the generic word that refers to all songs – gying lu (bravery songs), tho lu (wedding songs), chang lu (wine songs), lham lu (travel songs), garu (song for agricultural ploughing), and tsig lu (satirical songs) amongst others. The most popular were lharna, musical offerings for the gods. It is believed that there are 360 different types of musical offerings to gods, popularly referred to as lharna sum gya tukchu. There were also songs that extolled the virtues of the king and queen as well as high-ranking monks. The songs were largely divided into two categories: folk and religious. Romantic songs were rare.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
The singing was accompanied by musical instruments (mainly percussion, string and wind), such as the daman (a pair of kettle drums) and surna (similar to shenai). While music flourished throughout Ladakh, it thrived in Leh’s Old Town because of royal patronage. Some of the most popular tunes, many still known today, first emerged from here. This was further accentuated when the King Jamyang Namgyal (16th-17th century), married Gyal Khatoon from Baltistan. When the bride came to Leh she was accompanied by musicians from Baltistan who settled in Leh and became the royal musicians, locally known as the khar-mons (more commonly referred to as mons). Jamyang Namgyal and Gyal Khatoon were Sengge Namgyal’s parents and under him, and following rulers, musicians were patronised and their art prospered. It emerged as both an indigenous art form but one that was also influenced from outside. In the lyrics and the instruments influences of Ladakh’s neighbouring regions, such as Himachal and Tibet are evident, demonstrating the multi-ethnic nature of music in the region.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Traditional Ladakhi marriage ceremonies include a large and varied repertoire of songs, that cover classic poetry and a range of expressions that capture every ceremony with great subtlety. Often folk songs are a rich portrayal of imagination, love, tragedy, elation and hope incredibly interwoven into a complex web possibly in a single composition. Every occasion begins with stendel lu or auspicious songs of interdependence and concludes with good luck songs or tashis pe lu accompanied by the music of the daman and surna.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
In the recent decades Hindi films have strong influences in Ladakhi music, as has western rock and pop music and more recently rap.

<h3 class="text-left mt-4 para-title"> FOOD:</h3>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
The harsh climate and high altitude pose challenging life choices for the inhabitants. Difficult terrain problem of accessibility and limited resources for survival have led to the utmost importance towards farming and sustainability. Food, just like in any other community, is central in Ladakhi customary practices.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Agriculture is foremost in Ladakhi life, and necessary for sustenance. However, this varies across the region depending on altitude and climatic conditions. In lower Ladakh (also known as Sham) a much wider variety of crops are grown, including fruit, and some parts have two cropping seasons. The major crops grown here are wheat, barely, buckwheat, peas, potatoes, carrots, radish, turnips, green leafy vegetables, and pulses. As well as fruits such as grapes, apples and apricots. In contrast, the north-eastern areas of Ladakh, called Changthang, are predominantly inhabited by nomadic pastoralists, who keep livestock as the land does not allow them to practice much agriculture though some attempts have been made. In between these two areas live a semi-nomadic community who are part agriculturalists and part pastoral.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Traditionally, the staple diet of the region is barley flour, also called phey, tsampa and satu. Other important varieties of crops include wheat and buckwheat. After it has been roasted and ground, phey is eaten in multiple ways in Ladakhi households. As kholak, it is made into a soft dough with salted butter tea, a very common household drink during all seasons. Then there is paba (or zan), which involves mixing the barley four with tang thur (a mix of yogurt, chopped coriander leaves and a little chilli powder). This is a very nutritious and an excellent food source, that ensures you will not be hungry for hours at a stretch.  Both kholak and paba are also eaten along with curry, yogurt, tzong chu (onion curry) or sha chu (meat curry).
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
​
Chang (local barley beer) is an alcoholic drink made from fermenting barley. It is especially popular during the agricultural season, when farmers tend to their fields. Other beverages include the gur-gur cha or salted butter tea. Interestingly, with Leh as a confluence for trade, several varieties of food items travelled to Ladakh and entered the local cuisine. Many of these are made even today: Yarkandi pulao (rice is not grown in Ladakh and was introduced much later on), samso (Yarkandi samosa, not fried but baked in a tandoor), mok-mok or momo (which travelled from Nepal, where it was called Momocha in Nepali to Central
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Asia and then to Ladakh) including others. Potatoes and turnips grown today in Ladakh were introduced by the Moravian Missionaries when they settled in Leh in the 19 th Century. Tea, used to make butter tea, also made its way into Ladakh from Tibet through what is called the Chaba Mission (cha is the local word for tea). This was in the 17 th century, with the Chaba being a counter to the Lopchak Mission sent from Leh to Lhasa. Before this, rus pey cha or ‘bone tea’, tea made out of leaves of thorny bushes, local rose hips etc. were used to make tea in this region. Since then, butter tea has become extremely popular in Ladakh.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Nowadays in Ladakh, a large variety of imported food products are available such as rice, lentils, varieties of flour, sugar, tea amongst others. This has changed the staple diet of the region. A number of restaurants, as well as introduction of international eclectic cuisines such as Korean and Israeli, has also changed the eating habits of the people of this region.

<h3 class="text-left mt-4 para-title"> TRADITIONAL DRESS:</h3>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Traditional Ladakhi clothes come from woolen material called Nambu. This textile comes from sheep and is handspun and hand woven into fine cloth pieces before they are tailored to make the traditional Ladakhi dress called the kos. Goncha or Mogos in the case of females and Pho gos or just kos for the males.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
The younger children wear pho gos, which can be seen as a gender-neutral dress. These kos comes in white, maroon colour (dyed) or those which are multicolored and made through thigma (tie and dye process) are also seen worn by women. Apart from the main attire a lot of jewellery on women like the Perak, turquoise headgear studded with kau (hexagonal gold amulet); pearl earrings; white conch shell bangles; silver chest pieces like Docha, along with several other precious and semi precious items.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
​
Traditionally, men, also wore a lot of jewellery items apart from Tibi (hat), including turquoise earrings, finger rings and an array of items tied up to the waist belt. However, these days, we can see a lot of influence of modern day clothes on the men as well as women. Old as well as young.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Clothes and their usage is interesting, since, we see a lot of women wear salwar and kurta (influence from Punjabi clothes style) and of course jeans and other global fashion styles.

<h3 class="text-left mt-4 para-title"> ARCHITECTURE:</h3>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
The construction of a Ladakhi house, especially those belonging to more affluent Ladakhis, is a good example of the use of wood in the building and interiors. There is a wooden flooring (shing shen), window paneling (shing sak), ceilings made out of small thin pieces of talu, beams(dungma), and pillars (ka). Other architectural features include small windows, low doors, open shelves in the kitchen (langs), and balconies (rabsal). Furniture was minimal includes low wooden platforms for seating with short tables (choktsey) placed in front of them. Walnut wood were particularly used for making choktsey, par shing or wooden printing blocks to hand print Buddhist religious texts as well as flags and shen or shing ten (wooden carpet), wooden floors. The tables are usually fold able, adorned with distinct patterns carved on them such as dragons, mythical birds and flowers. These are also painted in bright colours. In monasteries and mosques a more abundant use of wood is visible, often elaborately carved and painted. Ceilings are generally higher, so pillars are longer with carved and painted capitals, doors are wider . Elaborate altars and pulpits can also be seen.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
Vernacular architecture in Ladakh has developed indigenously and also been influenced by Tibetan, Central Asian, and Kashmiri styles. Building materials are largely made from sundried bricks, stone and wood.
</p>
<p class="text-left mb-3 description"> 
A traditional Ladakhi house is usually two-storied.  The ground floor is reserved for livestock such as cows, goat, and sheep. This method helps in insulating the floor above. The staircase connecting the two floors of the house is made out of big slabs of rock; generally yamangs (a type of slate) is used.  Usually a house has a courtyard (often on the upper floor) that leads into a large multi-functional kitchen area, a Buddhist chapel (in a Buddhist house), a sleeping quarter (zims-chung), a glass room (shel khang) which also serves as a guest room, local dry toilet (usually sits on the first floor of the main house, or can be separate as well).
